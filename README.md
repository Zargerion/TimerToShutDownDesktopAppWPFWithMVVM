# Timer to shutdown your Windows with GUI and with analog and digital clock that builded using C# WPF and partially with MVVM.
XAML was really intresting. My first work with C#, WPF that has complited near around 3 days.

## Download

So, now you need "git". If you haven't, google how to get (https://git-scm.com/book/ru/v2/%D0%92%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%A3%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0-Git).

Make a derectory. In this directory using console write:

```git clone https://github.com/Zargerion/TimerToShutDownDesktopAppWPFWithMVVM.git```

<ins> Of course you can simply download it to your created directory using grafic interface GitHub.com as you wish. </ins>

## Install

(It's more about make a beauty icon in your Windows decktop, becouse already now you can run .exe file in "bin" folder in your directory and be using this).

In your directory come to "bin" folder -> "Release" folder. Make a shortcut of .exe file and replace the shortcut to your desktop. Rename shortcut as you want. Click on right button of your mose at the shortcut and cho–æse "properties". In the window that appears, select "change icon". Specify the icon at ```/root_directory_of_this_app/Image/favicon.ico```.

Congratulations, now it's fully done!
